Hello! My name is Mauro Bonfietti.

I'm Software Engineer with over +10 years of work experience as backend software developer.

I like reading and learning new technologies.

Currently, I work from home and live in Rosario, Argentina. 

In my spare time, I like to play football with my friends, watch tv series and read books.

I also love to spend quality time with my family ;-)

You can find me on [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mauro-bonfietti/) and also on [github](https://github.com/maurobonfietti/).
