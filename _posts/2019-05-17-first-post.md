Hello! My name is Mauro Bonfietti.

I'm Software Engineer with over +10 years of work experience as backend developer.

I like reading and learning new technologies.

Currently, I live in Rosario (Argentina) and work from home.

In my spare time, I like to play soccer with my friends and watch tv series.

I also love to spend quality time with my family ;-)

You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mauro-bonfietti/) and also on [GitHub](https://github.com/maurobonfietti/).
