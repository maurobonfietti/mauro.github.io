Hello! My name is Mauro Bonfietti.

I'm Software Engineer with over +10 years of work experience as backend developer.

Currently, I'm working from home for Aivo.

I live in Rosario, Argentina.

I like reading and learning new technologies.

On my spare time, I like to play football with my friends, watch tv series and read books.

Also, I love to spend quality time with my family.
